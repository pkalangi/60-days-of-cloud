# Day 02 – S3 Bucket with Versioning & Lifecycle

**Date:** 23 Nov 2025

### What I Did
- Created S3 bucket in Mumbai region
- Uploaded personal resume
- Enabled versioning (recover deleted files)
- Added lifecycle rule → old versions to Glacier after 30 days

### Key Learnings
- Versioning = safety net for production data
- Lifecycle = automatic cost savings
